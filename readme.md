Welcome to Teapot KiCAD Library!
Here are all of the KiCAD library that [Teapot's projects](https://github.com/teapotlaboratories) uses. Some are fetched from other source, and some are built in-house.

## To-Do
- Proper naming convention for library items

## License
Most 3D Model, Symbol and Footprint have it's own license. Look for readme.md for their license specification.
Please reach out or create a ticket to report any license violation.
