# Teapot KiCAD Library

Welcome to Teapot KiCAD Library!
Here are all of the KiCAD library that [Teapot's projects](https://github.com/aldwinhermanudin/teapot) uses. Some are fetched from other source, and some are built in-house.

## To-Do
- Proper naming convention for library items
- Add reference to original source
- General Clean-Up
